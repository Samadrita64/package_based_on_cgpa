# package_based_on_cgpa
"Packages based on CGPA" refers to the expected salary offers (packages) that students may receive during placements based on their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). The assumption is: higher CGPA → better chances of higher package, though this is not always linear and can depend on other factors like skills, internships, or the company profile.

| **CGPA** | **Expected Package (LPM)** |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| 6.0      | ₹2.5                       |
| 7.0      | ₹3.0                       |
| 8.0      | ₹4.5                       |
| 8.5      | ₹6.0                       |
| 9.0      | ₹8.0                       |
| 9.5+     | ₹10.0+                     |
